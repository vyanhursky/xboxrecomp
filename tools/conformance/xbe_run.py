"""Conformance against a real title: lift the game's own code and run both.

Xbox code is 32-bit x86 and this harness is a 32-bit x86 process, so the game's
machine code is not merely liftable, it is *executable*. Map the XBE where it
was linked for, call one of its functions directly, then run the lifted C over
the same arguments and compare. The oracle is the shipped binary itself.

That is only safe for functions we can show are self-contained, so candidates
are chosen mechanically rather than by hand:

  * a standard `push ebp; mov ebp, esp` prologue, and a plain `ret` -- not
    `ret imm16`, because a stdcall callee cleans a number of argument bytes we
    would have to guess, and guessing wrong corrupts the caller's stack;
  * no `call`, so nothing reaches the kernel, the CRT or an unmapped address;
  * every memory operand either esp/ebp-relative (its own frame and arguments)
    or an absolute address inside a mapped section, so it cannot dereference
    an argument we invented;
  * no `fs:` access (SEH), no string operations (they walk esi/edi as
    pointers), no privileged or I/O instructions;
  * and nothing that lifts to a bare comment, since an unhandled instruction is
    a silent no-op that the comparison cannot see.

Arguments are small integers. A function that treated one as a pointer would
fault -- but the operand rule above already excludes those, and the native call
runs under an exception guard regardless.
