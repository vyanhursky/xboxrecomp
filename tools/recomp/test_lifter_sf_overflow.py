"""SF after a compare is the sign bit of the WRAPPED difference.

`cmp` snapshots its operands sign-extended into _fas/_fbs, so the natural
spelling of `js` is

    (int32_t)((_fas) - (_fbs)) < 0

and that is what this lifter emitted. Signed overflow is undefined behaviour in
C, and this subtraction overflows for precisely the inputs the question is
about: `cmp 0x80000000, 1` leaves 0x7FFFFFFF on the hardware, so SF is 0, while
the C expression is INT_MIN - 1.

MEASURED, AND THE MEASUREMENT HAS A TRAP IN IT. At -O2 Apple clang 21 gets
both overflowing vectors wrong:

    cmp 0x80000000, 1          x86 SF=0    emitted 1
    cmp 0x7FFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF x86 SF=1    emitted 0

But only when the operands are not compile-time constants. Call the same
function with literals and clang constant-folds it and produces the correct
wrapped answer, at every -O level -- so a quick check written that way reports
"no problem at -O0 through -O3" and is measuring the constant folder rather
than the emitted code. Guest operands are never literals, so the folded form
is the one that does not matter. The compiled arm below feeds its vectors
through an array for exactly this reason.

Unsigned subtraction is defined to wrap, so the fix is to subtract in the
unsigned type of the operand's own width and take the top bit. That is the
hardware's SF at every width with no undefined case.

Only `s`/`ns` are affected. `jl`/`jge`/`jle`/`jg` are NOT: SF != OF is
mathematically signed-less-than, and the CMP_L/CMP_G macros already compute it
without a subtraction.

The compiled arm below is the load-bearing one -- the defect is invisible at
-O0, so a test that does not optimise cannot see it.
