What recomp_manual.c defines.

Single source of truth, deliberately. Both the recompiler (deciding what NOT to
generate) and gen_dangling_stubs.py (deciding what still needs a stub) have to
agree on what counts as a definition. When they each had their own regex they
disagreed, and every disagreement is a link error: a definition missed by one
becomes "already defined", a definition invented by the other becomes
"unresolved external".
