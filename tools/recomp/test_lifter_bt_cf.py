"""bts/btr/btc report the bit they found, not the bit they left.

All four bit-test instructions copy the tested bit into CF. Only `bt` leaves
the bit alone; `bts` sets it, `btr` clears it and `btc` flips it. The lifter
answered a following carry condition by reading the bit a second time, at the
consumer -- which for the three modifying forms reads back whatever they just
wrote:

    bts -> the bit is now 1, so "jb" was ALWAYS taken
    btr -> the bit is now 0, so "jb" was NEVER taken
    btc -> the bit is inverted, so the branch went exactly the wrong way

That is the test-and-set idiom -- "did I claim this, or was it already taken?"
-- reading its own answer. MSVC emits it for lock acquisition and for the
character-map loops behind strpbrk/strspn/strcspn, where `bts [esp], eax`
populates a 256-bit set and the carry says whether the character was already
present. Against the old code every character in such a set reported "already
present" on the first insertion.

The lift already captured the pre-write value into _cf. Two things stopped it
being used: the consumer preferred its own re-read, and _function_needs_cf did
not count the bt family as CF producers -- CF_TRACKED is only add/sub/adc/sbb/
shl/shr/sar -- so for a function whose sole carry consumer followed a `bts`,
the capture was never even emitted. Both halves are fixed; this pins both.

Plain `bt` keeps the re-read deliberately: it is exact, and it avoids forcing
_cf emission across a whole function for the common read-only case.
