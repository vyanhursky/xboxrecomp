"""Self-check that no reserved name reaches the generated C unmangled.

`_func_ident` is the last guard before a func_db name becomes a C token, and
the only one every name source passes through -- Ghidra, IDA, a hand-written
symbols file. `tools/ghidra_naming/merge_names.py` filters a similar set
earlier, but it sees the Ghidra path alone.

The C99 `<math.h>` classification names are the sharp case, because they are
function-like *macros*. A guest function recovered as `isnan` does not
collide, it expands: `void isnan(void);` becomes
`void (fpclassify(void) == FP_NAN);` and the compiler reports a bad parameter
declarator inside `corecrt_math.h`, naming neither the guest function nor the
clash. Reported from a FIFA Street 2 port, where it cost a day.

Both checks compile against the headers a generated TU actually includes, and
the positive sweep is paired with a negative control that feeds the same
harness the unmangled name and requires it to fail -- a sweep that passes
against both spellings is testing nothing.
