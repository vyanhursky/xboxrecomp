"""Self-check for `sar` at 8 and 16 bits, and for its shift count.

`sar` used to lift to "(uint32_t)((int32_t)dst >> cnt)" at every width. Narrow
reads arrive zero-extended -- LO8/HI8/LO16 mask, MEM8/MEM16 are unsigned -- so
at 8 and 16 bits that int32_t cast never saw a sign bit and the ">>" was a
logical shift wearing an arithmetic cast. `sar al, 1` with al = 0x80 produced
0x40 where x86 produces 0xC0: a negative number halved into a positive one,
the shape of a fixed-point divide or a signed average going wrong without
faulting.

The count was also unmasked. x86 masks it to 5 bits for 8-, 16- and 32-bit
operands; in C a shift of 33 on a 32-bit type is undefined.

These checks compile the lifter's own output and sweep it against a reference
that computes the x86 answer with a signed type of the right width. Each one
is paired with a negative control that feeds the same harness the pre-fix
expression and requires the sweep to reject it -- a sweep that passes against
both spellings would be testing nothing.
