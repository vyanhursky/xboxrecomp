    Post-process generated C lines to insert _icall_esp save points.

    When RECOMP_ICALL_SAFE is used, we need to save g_esp BEFORE any
    args are pushed so the macro can restore it on lookup failure.

    Scans backwards from each RECOMP_ICALL_SAFE line to find consecutive
    PUSH32 lines (the arg pushes), then inserts a save before the first.

    A push of a callee-saved register can be either the function saving it or
    an argument that happens to live in it, and the two need telling apart:
    absorbing a save makes the failure path rewind g_esp over the function's
    own frame, and the epilogue then pops its registers from too high -- silent
    caller corruption. Leaving an argument behind is the mirror image, and
    shifts the epilogue the other way.

    Push and pop counts separate them. A register popped at least as often as
    it is pushed is restored on every path out, so a push of it is a save and
    the argument run ends there -- "at least", not "exactly", because a
    function with several epilogues pops once per return path. A register
    pushed more often than it is popped has a push nobody restores -- an
    argument -- and the run absorbs it as before.

    Where that is still ambiguous, stopping early is the safer error: it
    under-rewinds, which surfaces as the detectable "epilogue never ran" leak,
    rather than as a caller silently carrying a wrong register.
