"""
Self-check for flags reaching a loop head across a back edge.

Blocks are lifted in address order, so the predecessor on a back edge sits
after the block it jumps to and has no computed out-state on a first pass.
The join that decides what flag state a block inherits then sees an unknown
predecessor and gives up, which is safe -- and expensive, because the jcc at
the top of a counted loop is exactly that shape. It lifts to the `_flags`
fallback, a variable nothing ever assigns, so the branch is compiled as never
taken and the loop has no exit.

Shin Megami Tensei: Nine has one in its XMV decoder's row padding:

    mov eax, 0Bh
    sub eax, [ebp+20h]      ; sets ZF
  L:
    jz  done                ; <-- both predecessors set ZF from eax
    movq [edi], mm0
    add edi, edx
    dec eax                 ; sets ZF
    jmp L

Lifted with the fallback it stored eight bytes and advanced edi by sixteen
until it left mapped memory, taking the process with it. Settling the flag
state to a fixed point before emitting gives the jcc its comparison back.

The second property matters as much: when the predecessors genuinely
disagree, neither one's flags may be inherited. Inheriting the wrong flags is
worse than inheriting none, because the branch then looks right and goes the
wrong way. Such a join now has each edge evaluate the condition itself into a
variable of the join (translator._edge_flag_plan) instead of the fallback.
