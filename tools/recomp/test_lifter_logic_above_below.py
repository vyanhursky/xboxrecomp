"""Self-check for `jbe`/`ja` after and/or/xor.

and/or/xor clear CF, so `jb` and `jae` after one of them really are the
constants 0 and 1. `jbe` and `ja` are not: jbe is CF|ZF and ja is !CF && !ZF,
and ZF is whatever the result was. Folding all four to constants meant
"and eax, eax; jbe" never branched and "and eax, eax; ja" always did -- a
branch that is wrong exactly when the result is zero, and right the rest of
the time, so it survives most traffic and then takes the wrong arm on the
empty list, the null handle, the zero count.

The lifter already spells both conditions out correctly elsewhere: the
CF_TRACKED path emits "(_cf || lhs == 0)" and "(!_cf && lhs != 0)", and `test`
goes through CMP_BE/CMP_A. With CF known 0 those are exactly ZF and !ZF.

The sweep below compiles the lifter's own condition and compares it against CF
and ZF computed from x86's definitions, and is paired with a negative control
that feeds the same harness the pre-fix constants and requires them to fail.
