/**
 * Xbox Memory Layout Implementation
 *
 * Maps the XBE data sections to their expected virtual addresses on Windows.
 * This is critical for the recompiled code which references globals by
 * absolute address (e.g., mov eax, [0x004D532C]).
 *
 * Implementation:
 * 1. VirtualAlloc a contiguous region at XBOX_BASE_ADDRESS
 * 2. Copy .rdata and initialized .data from the XBE
 * 3. Zero-fill the BSS region
 * 4. Set memory protection (read-only for .rdata)

 *
 * Each of the three DMA channels -- PCM In, PCM Out, Mic In -- has a one-byte

 * Software sets it and waits for the controller to clear it. DDS9 does that

 *
 *     mov  cl, [eax+0xFEC0010B]
 *     and  cl, 2
 *   L: test cl, cl
 *     jne  L

 * MSVC hoisted the load out of the loop -- the pointer was not volatile -- so
 * the title reads the register exactly ONCE, a few instructions after writing
 * it, and spins forever on whatever that single read returned. On hardware
 * the reset has long completed by then.
 *
 * That rules out the NV2A_ACK approach. A thread that clears the bit
 * afterwards is racing a window a few instructions wide and gets only one
 * attempt; measured, it loses, and the title sits on a stale cl = 2 while the
 * register itself reads 0. The bit has to be clear at the moment of the read,
 * which means the write must never deposit it.
 *
 * So the page is PAGE_READONLY: reads run at full speed and see plain memory,
 * writes fault. The fault handler makes the page writable, single-steps the
 * faulting instruction, then masks RR out of the three control bytes and
 * re-protects. No instruction decoding, which matters because the write forms
 * a compiler emits here are not worth enumerating -- and being wrong about
 * one would corrupt a register rather than fail visibly.
