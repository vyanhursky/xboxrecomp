 * Xbox Memory Layout Implementation
 *
 * Maps the XBE data sections to their expected virtual addresses on Windows.

 * Implementation:
 * 1. VirtualAlloc a contiguous region at XBOX_BASE_ADDRESS
 * 2. Copy .rdata and initialized .data from the XBE
 * 3. Zero-fill the BSS region
 * 4. Set memory protection (read-only for .rdata)

 *
 * Each of the three DMA channels -- PCM In, PCM Out, Mic In -- has a one-byte

 * Software sets it and waits for the controller to clear it. DDS9 does that

 *     mov  cl, [eax+0xFEC0010B]

 * the title reads the register exactly ONCE, a few instructions after writing
 * it, and spins forever on whatever that single read returned. On hardware
 * the reset has long completed by then.
 *
 * That rules out the NV2A_ACK approach. A thread that clears the bit
 * afterwards is racing a window a few instructions wide and gets only one
 * attempt; measured, it loses, and the title sits on a stale cl = 2 while the
 * register itself reads 0. The bit has to be clear at the moment of the read,
 * which means the write must never deposit it.
 *
 * So the page is PAGE_READONLY: reads run at full speed and see plain memory,
 * writes fault. The fault handler makes the page writable, single-steps the
 * faulting instruction, then masks RR out of the three control bytes and
 * re-protects. No instruction decoding, which matters because the write forms
 * a compiler emits here are not worth enumerating -- and being wrong about
 * one would corrupt a register rather than fail visibly.

         * the reset finishes. Against plain memory it stays set, and a title
         * that waits for it never stops waiting.
         *
         * Def Jam: Fight for NY does exactly that inside DirectSound. At guest
         * 0x00267B5A it writes CR = 2, reads the same byte back at 0x00267B6A,
         * masks bit 1, and then spins on a two-instruction loop that reloads
         * nothing:
         *
         *     test cl, cl
         *     jne  $-2
         *
         * so the value it is waiting on can only have changed before the loop
         * was entered. The title reaches its loading screen, draws it, and
         * stops there with one thread pinned in that loop making no kernel
         * calls at all -- which is why it reads as idle rather than as a hang.
         *
         * Clearing the bit here rather than emulating the controller matches
         * what NV2A_ACK above already does for the GPU's handshakes, and is the
         * same shape of answer: nothing here is going to report a reset that
         * did not happen, so "already finished" is the truthful reply.
         *
         * MEASURED: this does NOT release that particular spin, and cannot.
         * The title reads the byte into cl six instructions after writing it
         * and then loops on the register, so by the time this thread runs, ten
         * milliseconds later, the value it is testing was latched long ago and
         * no store to memory can reach it. Releasing that loop needs the bit to
         * read back clear at the instant of the read, which means trapping the
         * AC'97 page and masking RR on the write rather than acking it after
         * the fact. Kept because it is correct for any handshake whose loop
         * re-reads, which is the usual shape, and because leaving the bit set
         * is wrong regardless.
         *
         * Only bit 1 is touched. Bit 0 is RPBM, run/pause bus master, which is
         * real state the title owns. AC'97 sits at +0x400000 in this aperture,
         * well outside the 512 KB the APU trap covers, so this is unaffected by
         * whether that trap is armed.
