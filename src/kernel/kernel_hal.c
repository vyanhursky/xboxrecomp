 * emitted a comment for each one and moved on, which left the destination
 * register holding whatever the previous instruction had put there. A read of
 * a status bit then returned a different answer on every call, and nothing
 * said so.
 *

 * runtime has no southbridge, so a read reports a device that is present and
 * idle, and a write is accepted and dropped. Both are counted and the first
 * few of each port are logged, because "which ports does this title use" is a
 * question you can only answer by running it, and because a title that hangs
 * on one of these needs the port number in the log to stand a chance.
 *
 * Reads return zero. On this hardware most of these registers are status
 * words whose bits mean "pending" or "busy", and zero is the truthful answer
 * for a machine where nothing is pending and nothing is busy — the same
 * reasoning the NV2A interrupt registers are held at zero under.
