/*
 * Scaled presentation: the title renders into a target of its own size and
 * that picture is drawn into a window of any size.
 *
 * Without this the swap chain is the title's size times the render scale and
 * DXGI stretches it over whatever the window happens to be, so a resized or
 * full-screen window distorts the picture. With it the swap chain follows the
 * window, the title's target stays what it was, and each present draws one
 * into the other: filling the window, or at a fixed aspect ratio with black
 * bars.
 *
 * Opt-in. A host that does not call d3d8_present_enable_scaling gets the
 * swap chain and the behaviour it always had.
 *
 * Plain C types only, so the fitting arithmetic can be tested without a
 * Direct3D device.
