/*
 * d3d8_vk.h -- what the Vulkan backend needs from the program that hosts it.
 *
 * The backend creates the Vulkan instance and device and draws; it does not
 * create a window. A host that has one says which instance extensions its
 * window system needs and how to make a surface for it, before the device is
 * created. With no host set (or a host that returns no surface) the backend
 * renders off screen: every frame is drawn and can be captured, and nothing
 * is presented. That is what an unattended test run on a machine without a
 * display uses.

 * render pass on the window's image (colour attachment, the picture already in
 * it, kept), calls `draw` on the thread that presents with the frame's command
 * buffer recording inside that pass, and ends it. `draw` records draw commands
 * and nothing else it must not submit that buffer. Handles are Vulkan's, as
 * plain pointers so this header does not need vulkan.h.
 *
 * `generation` changes whenever `render_pass` or the image count was replaced
 * (a swap chain with another format); a host that built pipelines against the
 * pass makes them again. The picture a harness captures is the title's target,
