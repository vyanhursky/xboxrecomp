/*
 * Player-facing settings: one table, one file.
 *
 * A host program declares its settings as a table of RecompSetting and
 * registers it once. The table is the single source every front end goes
 * through -- the settings file, hotkeys, an overlay, a launcher -- so a value
 * changed in one place is the value everywhere.
 *
 * Precedence, lowest first: the table's default, the settings file, the
 * setting's environment variable. An environment variable is a per-run
 * override for scripts and diagnostics: it wins while it is set and is never
 * written to the file.
 *
 * The file is INI: "[section]" headers, "key = value" lines, and comments
 * starting with ';' or '#'. Keys this table does not know are kept and written
 * back, so a file shared between versions of a program loses nothing.
 *
 * Portable C with no dependencies. Not thread-safe for registration, loading
 * or saving; recomp_settings_get is safe to call from any thread once the
 * table is loaded, and recomp_settings_set takes an internal lock.
