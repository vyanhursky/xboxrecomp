/*
 * ohci.h -- the Xbox USB host controllers, enough of them to be found.
 *
 * A title reaches its gamepad through XAPI, which is statically linked into
 * the image and drives the OHCI controller registers directly rather than
 * going through anything this runtime can shim. Half-Life 2 registers a 4 KB
 * block at 0xFED00000 and takes an interrupt vector for it, then reads
 * HcRevision out of an aperture backed by zeroed RAM, concludes there is a
 * host controller with no root hub ports, and enumerates nothing.
 *
 * This is the register half of the answer: a controller that reports a real
 * revision, a root hub with ports, and the handful of registers that have
 * behaviour rather than storage. It does not yet walk the endpoint and
 * transfer descriptor lists, which is what actually moves a report, so a
 * driver that gets this far will find a port and then have nothing to talk to.
 * That is deliberate -- the register trace is what says whether the driver
 * polls HcInterruptStatus or waits on the IRQ, and that answers how much of
 * the rest is needed before any of it is written.
 *
 * Written from the OHCI 1.0a specification and this title's own code.
