 * A host controller is a bus master: the driver builds endpoint and transfer
 * descriptors in RAM, points HcControlHeadED at them and sets ControlListFilled,
 * and the controller walks that list itself. Nothing arrives through MMIO, so
 * none of this is visible to the register trace -- which is why the driver
 * looked idle after the port came up.
 *
 * OHCI 1.0a, section 4. An endpoint descriptor is four dwords:
 *
 *   +0  FA | EN<<7 | D<<11 | S<<13 | K<<14 | F<<15 | MPS<<16
 *   +4  TailP        queue tail, 16-byte aligned
 *   +8  HeadP        queue head, with Halted in bit 0 and toggleCarry in bit 1
 *   +C  NextED
 *
 * and a general transfer descriptor is four more:
 *
 *   +0  ... DP<<19 | DI<<21 | T<<24 | EC<<26 | CC<<28
 *   +4  CBP          current buffer pointer, 0 when the transfer moved nothing
 *   +8  NextTD
 *   +C  BE           last byte of the buffer, inclusive
 *
 * A transfer is done when HeadP reaches TailP. Completed descriptors go on the
 * done queue, newest first, and the controller publishes it in the HCCA and
 * raises WritebackDoneHead.
