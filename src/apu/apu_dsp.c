/*
 * MCPX APU DSP (GP/EP) - Stub implementation
 *
 * The DSP Global Processor (GP) and Encode Processor (EP) handle effects
 * processing (reverb, chorus, etc.) and final output encoding. The full
 * DSP is ~3000 lines of DSP56300 emulation code.
 *
 * For initial audio, we bypass the DSP entirely:
 * - VP mixbins are passed directly to the EP output
 * - GP effects processing is skipped
 * - The EP just copies mixbin 0/1 (front L/R) to the monitor buffer
 *
 * This gives us basic voice playback without effects. The DSP can be
 * connected later for reverb, EQ, and other processing.

/* ── DSP command doorbell acknowledgement ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * DirectSound does not stop at creating the device. It hands the audio DSP a
 * command block in guest RAM, writes a command word, and spins until the DSP
 * writes zero back. On real hardware the GP runs a DSP56300 program that does
 * that. Here the DSP is a passthrough stub, so the word never changes and the
 * title hangs inside DirectSound initialisation -- which on Wreckless gates the
 * entire engine, not just audio.
 *
 * RECOMP_APU_DSP_ACK=<addr>[,<addr>...] clears those guest dwords once per APU
 * frame, which is what "the command completed" looks like to the title.
 *
 * ponytail: this is a handshake acknowledgement, not a DSP. It says every
 * command succeeded instantly and computes nothing, so anything whose *result*
 * the title reads back will still be wrong. The real fix is DSP56300 emulation
 * in the GP/EP; this exists so audio init stops blocking everything behind it.
 *
 * The address is not derivable from the APU registers: GPSADDR/GPFADDR/
 * EPSADDR/EPFADDR point at the DSP's own scratch and frame memory, while the
 * command block is a DirectSound heap allocation. On Wreckless the registers
 * read 0x01504000 / 0x014EC000 / 0x0151C000 / 0x014F0000 and the doorbell is at
 * 0x014F8810 -- inside none of them. So it has to be observed: run with
 * RECOMP_WATCHDOG_SECS and the spin shows up as ebx plus the poll offset.
