/*
 * mmio_trap.h -- trapped device registers on a POSIX host.
 *
 * On Windows a device page is left PAGE_NOACCESS and a vectored handler
 * decodes the faulting x86-64 instruction (mmio_decode.h). This is the same
 * arrangement for hosts where that cannot be reused as it stands:
 *
 *   - the fault arrives as SIGSEGV or SIGBUS with a ucontext;
 *   - on arm64 the faulting instruction is an A64 load or store, decoded
 *     here;
 *   - the host page may be larger than the 4 KB the console's devices are
 *     laid out in (16 KB on Apple Silicon). Protecting one device page then
 *     closes its neighbours too, so an access to a neighbour is completed
 *     against a second, always-open view of the same memory.
 *
 * The callbacks have the mmio_decode.h signatures, so a device model serves
 * both.
