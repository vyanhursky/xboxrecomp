/*
 * The one-guest-CPU token: see win32_compat.c.
 *
 *   1. Two joined threads never run at once. Each counts on its own, and a
 *      third thread looks at both counters twice, 50 microseconds apart.
 *      Side by side, both have moved in every such window; taking turns,
 *      only in a window that happened to contain a change-over, so in no
 *      more windows than there were change-overs.
 *   2. A joined thread spinning on a flag is preempted for the joined thread
 *      that sets it. Without preemption this never ends.
 *   3. A joined thread blocked in a wait does not hold the CPU: the thread
 *      that signals it gets to run.
 *   4. A thread interrupted outside the range given as guest code is not
 *      switched there; it hands over at its next checkpoint.
