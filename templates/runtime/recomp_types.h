/**
 * Xbox Static Recompilation - Runtime Type Definitions
 *
 * Type definitions and helper macros used by mechanically translated
 * x86 -> C code. Each original x86 function is translated to a C
 * function that uses these types and macros.
 *
 * This is a reusable template for ANY Xbox game. Game-specific
 * customization should go in separate headers.
 *
 * Memory model:
 *   Xbox data sections are mapped to their original VAs via
 *   CreateFileMapping + MapViewOfFileEx (see xbox_memory.h).
 *   Recompiled code accesses globals via pointer casts, e.g.:
 *     *(uint32_t*)0x003B2360
 *
 * Register model:
 *   Volatile registers (eax, ecx, edx, esp) are global variables,
 *   matching real x86 behavior where these registers are shared
 *   across all code. This enables correct argument passing via the
 *   simulated stack and return value communication via eax.
 *
 *   Callee-saved registers (ebx, esi, edi) are also global because
 *   callers pass implicit parameters through them (e.g. 'this' via
 *   esi in thiscall). The callee-save contract is enforced by
 *   PUSH32/POP32 instructions in the generated code, not by C local
 *   variable scoping.
 *
 *   ebp is NOT global - it stays local in each function because many
 *   FPO (Frame Pointer Omission) functions use it as scratch without
 *   save/restore. For SEH functions, g_seh_ebp bridges the gap.
 *
 * Calling convention:
 *   All translated functions are void(void). Arguments are passed
 *   on the simulated Xbox stack (via push instructions before call).
 *   Return values are communicated through g_eax.
 *   The call instruction pushes the real guest return address (the VA of
 *   the instruction after the call); ret discards it with esp += 4.
 *   The value is never used to transfer control -- control flow is C
 *   call/return -- but it must be correct because guest code reads it
 *   (__SEH_prolog's scope table, _alloca probes, "mov eax, [esp]").
